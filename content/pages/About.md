## PhD in statistics applied to biological sciences.

### What is my background?

My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Sports Science, where I acquired a strong foundation in integrative physiology. From my first year, I developed an interest in academic research, which led me to undertake early internships, including one at the Karolinska Institute, focused on skeletal muscle biology.

Then, I carried out a Masterâ€™s degree in Cellular and Molecular Biology. During this time, I was involved in two research projects that led to two publications. I then began a PhD in Canada in Muscle Stem Cell and Immunology, which I chose to quit due to insufficient resources for the project's feasibility.

Upon coming back to France, I held two research engineer positions (at INSERM), where I was responsible for leading projects at the intersection of several disciplines. These experiences allowed me to work closely with statisticians, biologists, and clinicians, and to develop a shared scientific language across domains. It was also during this period that I deepened my expertise in scientific computing and applied mathematics.

In that context, I co-wrote a PhD proposal with my former Master's advisor and a university professor in mathematics. This interdisciplinary PhD, which I successfully defended on June 18, 2025, focused on the co-adaptation between the gut microbiome and the host.

My atypical but coherent trajectory reflects several key strengths:

- A strong motivation and proven ability to engage with complex research topics, often beyond my initial field of expertise;
- Advanced technical skills in mathematical modelling, multidimensional data processing, and machine learning;
- Full autonomy in the conduct of research projects, from defining scientific questions to disseminating results, while maintaining continuous scientific monitoring;
- A confirmed ability to collaborate in interdisciplinary environments, with a strong capacity to adapt to diverse scientific cultures (biology, physics, computer science).
